### 1 | Flight Data Analysis
**Code:** [Flight_Data_Analysis](https://github.com/MichaelRommm/DATA_ANALYST_PORTFOLIO/blob/7b716c0616509bc1298ae182d242b65826560c7c/Python/project_folder/Flight_Data_Analysis)

**Goal:** Analyze and visualize flight data to derive insights on delays and flight patterns.

**Description:** This project fetches flight data from a public API, cleans the data, and performs exploratory data analysis. Various visualizations are created to understand flight delays, distributions, and patterns. The project also consolidates data from multiple sources to enhance the dataset.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data visualization, exploratory data analysis, merging datasets, handling missing values, working with datetime.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, API requests.

**Results:** The project showcases several [visualizations](https://github.com/MichaelRommm/DATA_ANALYST_PORTFOLIO/tree/239cfac1e21e5b069a1c092cc6c16ca1717e1e75/Python/output_visualizations_04_08_24):
- **Flight Status Distribution:** Provides insights into the proportions of different flight statuses.
- **Average Delay by Status:** Highlights average delays associated with different flight statuses.
- **Flights by Terminal:** Counts flights per terminal to identify the busiest terminals.
- **Top 10 Cities by Flight Count:** Identifies cities with the highest flight counts.
- **Top 10 Countries by Flight Count:** Identifies countries with the highest flight counts.
- **Average Delay by Terminal:** Analyzes which terminals have the most significant average delays.
- **Distribution of Delays:** Visualizes the distribution of delays to understand common delay durations.
- **Count of Flights per Hour of the Day:** Shows flight frequencies at different times of the day.
- **Count of Delayed Flights per Hour of the Day:** Highlights when delays are most frequent.
- **Planned vs Actual Time:** Scatter plot comparing planned vs actual flight times.

These visualizations provide actionable insights into flight operations and delays, aiding in operational improvements and strategic decision-making.
