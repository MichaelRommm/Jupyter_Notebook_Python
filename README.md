## 1 | Israeli Population Analysis 2015
**Code:** [Population_Analysis](BITUAH_LEUMI_2015.ipynb)

**Goal:** Analyze population data from Israeli cities with up to 2000 residents to identify key demographic patterns.

**Description:** This project utilizes a dataset provided by the National Insurance (Bituah Leumi) containing population data from December 2015. The analysis is conducted on cities with populations of up to 2000 people. The project demonstrates data manipulation and analysis techniques using Python, including reading data from an XML file, exploring data types, handling NaN values, and visualizing key demographic patterns.

**Skills:** Data analysis, data manipulation, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), XML data handling.

**Technology:** Python, Jupyter Notebook.

**Results:** The analysis provides insights into the population distribution of small Israeli cities, highlighting demographic trends and potential areas for further research.
